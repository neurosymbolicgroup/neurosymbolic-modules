These are sketched classes/methods that I call in rl/operations.py, meant to be a
sort of interface between the underlying graph data structure and the RL
actions.

Feel free to change any of these in their names or arguments and such. If you
do, just change where they're called in rl/operations.py or let Simon know and
he'll do it.
